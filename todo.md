Project Title:
Web-Based Application on Carbon Neutrality in Indian Coal Mines
1. Introduction
This project aims to develop a system to estimate, track, and visualize carbon emissions from coal mines in India. It also includes carbon sink estimation and neutrality pathway simulations to support coal mines in reducing their environmental impact. The system will provide an interactive dashboard, allowing users to access insights and make data-driven decisions.

2. Project Objectives
Automate carbon emission calculations using predefined formulas and real-world data.
Evaluate carbon sink potential based on afforestation and sequestration models.
Provide recommendations to achieve carbon neutrality based on AI-driven simulations.
Offer interactive dashboards and reports for easy visualization of emissions and mitigation strategies.
Ensure secure and role-based access for different users (admins, analysts, environmental officers, etc.).

3. Scope of the Project
The system will focus on coal mines in India, using real-time or historical data.
It will estimate carbon emissions based on coal production, fuel consumption, electricity usage, methane leaks, and stockpile emissions.
It will assess afforestation projects and their impact on CO₂ sequestration.
It will suggest pathways for carbon neutrality, including renewable energy adoption, improved mining processes, and afforestation.
Users will access the system via a web-based dashboard with real-time analytics.
